🌾 SMART FARM - Crop & Fertilizer Recommendation System
🚀 Project Overview
SMART FARM is a web-based machine learning application designed to assist farmers in improving agricultural productivity. By analyzing various soil and environmental parameters, this system provides:

Crop Recommendation: Suggests the most suitable crop based on soil nutrients and weather conditions.
Fertilizer Recommendation: Recommends the ideal fertilizer to optimize crop growth based on soil and crop type.

## 💡 Features

- 🌱 **Predict the best crop to cultivate** based on:
  - Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium levels
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - pH
  - Rainfall

- 🌾 **Suggest the most suitable fertilizer** considering:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Soil Moisture
  - Soil Type
  - Nutrient Levels (Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium)
  - Crop Type

- 🖥️ **User-friendly web interface** with Flask backend.

- 📊 **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Random Forest for both Crop and Fertilizer prediction (chosen due to highest accuracy).
