🌾 SMART FARM - Crop & Fertilizer Recommendation System
🚀 Project Overview
SMART FARM is a web-based machine learning application designed to assist farmers in improving agricultural productivity. By analyzing various soil and environmental parameters, this system provides:

Crop Recommendation: Suggests the most suitable crop based on soil nutrients and weather conditions.
Fertilizer Recommendation: Recommends the ideal fertilizer to optimize crop growth based on soil and crop type.

💡 Features
🌱 Predict the best crop to cultivate based on:
Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium levels
Temperature, Humidity, pH, Rainfall
🌾 Suggest the most suitable fertilizer considering:
Temperature, Humidity, Soil Moisture
Soil Type, Nutrient Levels, Crop Type
🖥️ User-friendly web interface with Flask backend.
📊 Machine Learning Models:
Random Forest for both Crop and Fertilizer prediction (chosen due to highest accuracy).

Technologies Used
Python
Flask
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualizations)
